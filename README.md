## File Email Classification.ipynb
The models used are those available in the Sklearn library.

Program execution sequence:

- Natural language processing with datasets.
- Split 2 datasets, train and test.
- Train model of Sklearn library with training dataset.
- Evaluate model quality by graphs, accuracy,...
- Evaluate the models against each other, choose the best model for the spam email classification problem.

The program correctly classified spam
Evaluate 7 classification algorithms and choose the best algorithm for spam classification problem.
